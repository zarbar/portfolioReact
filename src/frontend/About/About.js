                    I began training as a front and back end developer in April 2019. I use HTML 5, CSS (Bootstrap), Javascript (React, Jquery, Handlebars, Node, Express) for front-end development, Node and Express for back-end development and MySQL and MongoDB for databases.<br /><br />

                    My previous experience is in communications and marketing. I was born and raised in London and spent 5 years living and working in Japan.
