                    With a background in Anthropology and International Relations, I followed my curiosity to Japan, where I lived, travelled and worked for five years. I went from teaching high school English in a remote fishing town to the communications department at the School of Science of Japan's most esteemed university in central Tokyo.

                    It was there I learnt the importance of hard skills, and worked alongside web developers to create various websites for the university, peaking my interest. One of the highlights was using Google Analytics on our site, and completing the Google Analytics Academy courses.
                    <br /><br />
                    Upon returning to the UK, I again working in a communications role alongside web developers and IT professionals. By this point my job-envy was undeniable - I needed to get a piece of the action and unravel the mysteries of thier work!
                    <br />
                    In early 2019, I decided to finally take the plunge. Start afresh and learn to code. Re-wiring the part of my brain that previously dedicated to studying Japanese and my desire peer over the wall of the inner workings of the tech-world, and oh boy, I've loved every second of it.

                    I completed the <a href='https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/web-development' target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Codecademy full stack web development course</a> covering HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Node, building and connecting to API's, SQL and TDD methods. This included various frameworks and libraries such as Handlebars, React, jQuery, Express, Chai and Mocha. In October 2019, I joined <a href='https://kodiri.com/bootcamp' target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kodiri</a>, a two-month intensive coding bootcamp covering mobile-first UI and UX HTML5 and CSS3, Javascript, backend APIs, NodeJs and ExpressJs, MongoDB, cloud deployment with Heroku 

                    I began training as a front and back end developer in April 2019. I use HTML 5, CSS (Bootstrap), Javascript (React, Jquery, Handlebars, Node, Express) for front-end development, Node and Express for back-end development and MySQL and MongoDB for databases.<br /><br />

                    My previous experience is in communications and marketing. I was born and raised in London and spent 5 years living and working in Japan.
